# Almandine Package Manager â€“ Task Checklist (TASK.md)

**Purpose:** Tracks all tasks, milestones, and backlog for the Almandine Lua package manager. Each task includes a manual verification step for running and inspecting all tests and code.

**Multiplatform Policy:** All tasks, implementations, and verifications MUST consider cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, and Windows) unless otherwise specified. Contributors (including AI) are required to design, implement, and test with multiplatform support as a baseline expectation. Any platform-specific logic must be clearly documented and justified in both code and task notes.

---

## CLI Tool Name

- The CLI executable is called `almd` (short for Almandine).
- All documentation, usage, and examples should refer to the CLI as `almd` (not `almandine`).

---

## Milestone 1: Project Manifest & Initialization

- [x] **Task 1.1: Design and implement `project.lua` manifest schema**
  - [x] Define fields: `name`, `type`, `version`, `license`, `description`, `scripts`, `dependencies`.
  - [x] Manual Verification: Review schema, create sample file, and validate with test loader.

- [x] **Task 1.2: CLI command to initialize a new Almandine project**
  - [x] Implement `almd init` (creates `project.lua` with prompts).
  - [x] Create a portable shell wrapper script that finds a suitable Lua interpreter and runs `src/main.lua` with all arguments (works on macOS and Linux).
  - [x] Manual Verification: Run shell script with arguments, confirm it finds Lua and dispatches to `almd`.
  - [x] Manual Verification: Run `almd`, inspect output, ensure correct manifest generation.

- [x] **Task 1.3: Create Windows CLI wrapper script (`almd.bat`)** 
  - [x] Implement a batch script at the project root that finds a suitable Lua interpreter and runs `src/main.lua` with all arguments (works on Windows).
  - [x] Manual Verification: Run batch script with arguments, confirm it finds Lua and dispatches to `almd`.

## Milestone 2: Dependency Download & Pinning

- [x] **Task 2.1: Implement file downloader (GitHub/raw URL support)**

- [ ] **Task 4.2b: Make <dep_name> optional for `add` command (2025-04-28)**
  - [x] Allow `almd add <source>` (GitHub raw URL) with no explicit dependency name; infer name from filename in URL.

## Milestone 5: Installer and Wrapper Scripts

- [x] **Task 5.1: Cross-platform installer and advanced wrapper scripts for `almd` CLI**
  - [x] Create installer scripts (`install.sh`, `install.ps1`) to copy project files and wrapper scripts to user-specific locations on Linux/macOS and Windows.
  - [x] Implement robust wrapper scripts (`install/almd.sh`, `install/almd.bat`) that:
    - Locate a suitable Lua interpreter (`lua`, `lua5.4`, ..., `luajit`) automatically.
    - Always run the CLI from the script's directory for portability (not assuming install location).
    - Set `LUA_PATH` so that `src/lib` modules are found regardless of working directory (batch script only).
    - Forward all arguments to `src/main.lua`.
  - [ ] Manual Verification: Run installer on each platform, verify `almd` is available on the command line and launches the Lua app with arguments, even when run from any directory.

- [ ] **Task 5.2: Implement `self uninstall` command**
  - [ ] Add `almd self uninstall` to remove wrapper scripts and Lua CLI folder.

- [ ] **Task 5.3: Remote installer fetches and installs from GitHub Releases** (2025-04-28)
  - [ ] Update `install.sh` and `install.ps1` so they fetch and extract the distributable CLI zip from the latest (or specified) release on GitHub, using robust multiplatform methods (`curl`, `wget`, etc.).
  - [ ] Manual Verification: Download and run installer scripts on all platforms with no other files present, confirm correct CLI installation and usability.

- [ ] **Task 5.4: Modularize and delegate CLI help output** (2025-04-28)
  - [ ] Refactor all CLI help/usage output so that each command module in `src/modules/` exposes a `help_info()` function returning or printing its usage/help text (using `almd` as the CLI name).
  - [ ] Update `src/main.lua` to route `--help`/`help` invocations to the relevant module, and print a summary help if called as `almd --help` or `almd help` with no subcommand.
  - [ ] Manual Verification: Run `almd --help`, `almd help <command>`, and `almd <command> --help` to verify correct output and routing.

## Milestone 6: Automated Release Workflow & Changelog

- [x] **Task 6.1: Automated Release Workflow & Changelog (2025-04-28)**
  - [x] Add a GitHub Action in `.github/workflows` to:
    - Build a distributable release zip containing the CLI and all required files (for use by `almd self update`).
    - Automatically generate a changelog listing all changes since the previous release (using commit messages or PR titles).
    - Attach the zip and changelog to a new GitHub Release.
    - Ensure the workflow is professional and cross-platform aware.
  - [ ] Manual Verification: Trigger release, verify zip contents, changelog accuracy, and release quality.

- [ ] **Task 6.2: Migrate all src/spec tests to Busted framework (2025-04-28)**
  - [ ] For each test file in `src/spec` named `*_test.lua`, create a corresponding `*_spec.lua` using the Busted test library and idioms (`describe`, `it`, `assert`).
  - [ ] Preserve all test logic, grouping, and documentation; follow project Lua and LDoc standards.
  - [ ] Do not delete or move original files unless explicitly approved.
  - [ ] Manual Verification: Run all new specs with Busted, confirm all tests pass and logic is preserved.

## Lessons Learned (2025-04-28)

- **Never overwrite or assign to read-only global fields (e.g., `os.execute`) in tests or implementation code.**
  - This practice is flagged by luacheck and can cause subtle bugs or incompatibilities across Lua versions and environments.
  - **Preferred approach:** Refactor code to allow dependency injection (e.g., pass an executor function as a parameter), so tests can inject mocks or stubs without touching global state.
  - If output capture is required in tests, prefer dependency injection or local overrides. Directly overriding global functions like `print` or redirecting `io.output` may not work reliably in all environments (especially with Busted or other test runners).
  - Always verify that any test workaround is both cross-platform and compliant with project linting and style rules.
