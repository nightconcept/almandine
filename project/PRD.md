# Almandine Package Manager (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

Almandine (`almd` as the CLI command) is a lightweight package manager for Lua projects. It enables simple, direct management of single-file dependencies (from GitHub or other supported repositories), project scripts, and project metadata. Almandine is designed for projects that want to pin specific versions or commits of files without managing complex dependency trees.

## 2. Core Features

-   **Single-file Downloads:** Fetch individual Lua files from remote repositories (e.g., GitHub), pinning by semver (if available) or git commit hash.
-   **No Dependency Tree Management:** Only downloads files explicitly listed in the project; does not resolve or manage full dependency trees.
-   **Project Metadata:** Maintains project name, type, version, license, and package description in `project.lua`.
-   **Script Runner:** Provides a central point for running project scripts (similar to npm scripts).
-   **Lockfile:** Tracks exact versions or commit hashes of all downloaded files for reproducible builds (`almd-lock.lua`).
-   **License & Description:** Exposes license and package description fields in `project.lua` for clarity and compliance.
-   **Cross-Platform:** Cross-platform compatible (Linux, macOS, and Windows).

### 2.1. Core Commands (Initial Focus)

-   **(New) `add` command:**
    -   **Goal:** Adds a single-file dependency from a supported source (initially GitHub URLs) to the project.
    -   **Functionality:**
        -   Parses the provided URL (e.g., GitHub file link).
        -   Downloads the specified file (handling raw content URLs).
        -   Saves the downloaded file to the configured target directory (default: `lib/`, overrideable with `-d`).
        -   Updates the `project.lua` file, adding or modifying the dependency entry under the `dependencies` table. The key will be the derived filename or a name specified via `-n`. The value will be the source URL or a simplified representation (e.g., `github:user/repo/path/file.lua@commit_hash`).
        -   Updates the `almd-lock.lua` file with the resolved details: path within the project, exact source URL used, and a hash (either the commit hash if specified in the URL, or a calculated sha256 hash of the downloaded content otherwise).
    -   **Arguments:**
        -   `<url>`: The URL to the file (required).
        -   `-d <directory>` or `--directory <directory>`: Specifies a target directory relative to the project root (e.g., `src/engine/lib`). Defaults to `lib/`.
        -   `-n <name>` or `--name <name>`: Specifies the name to use for the dependency in `project.lua` and as the base filename (without extension). Defaults to the filename derived from the URL.

## 3. Folder Structure

Sample minimal structure for an Almandine-managed project:

-   `project.lua`          # Project manifest (metadata, scripts, dependencies)
-   `almd-lock.lua`   # Lockfile (exact versions/hashes of dependencies)
-   `scripts/`             # (Optional) Project scripts
-   `lib/`                 # (Optional) Default directory for downloaded packages/files
-   `src/`                 # (Optional) Project source code
    * `lib/`               # (Optional) Internal reusable modules (e.g., downloader, lockfile)
    * `modules/`           # All CLI command modules (init, add, remove, etc.)
* `install/`             # Cross-platform CLI wrapper scripts
    * `almd`               # Bash/sh wrapper for Linux/macOS (portable, finds Lua, runs from script dir)
    * `almd.ps1`           # Batch wrapper for Windows PowerShell (portable, finds Lua, runs from script dir, sets LUA_PATH)

## 4. File Descriptions

### `project.lua`

Project manifest. Example fields:

```lua
return {
  name = "my-lua-project",
  lua = ">=5.1",
  type = "library", -- or "application"
  version = "1.0.0",
  license = "MIT",
  description = "A sample Lua project using Almandine.",
  scripts = {
    test = "lua tests/run.lua",
    build = "lua build.lua"
  },
  dependencies = {
    -- Example entry after `almd add <url> -n lunajson` (if semver parsing added later)
    ["lunajson"] = "~1.3.4",
    -- Example entry after `almd add https://github.com/user/repo/path/file.lua@abcdef`
    ["file"] = "github:user/repo/path/file.lua@abcdef",
    -- Example entry after `almd add <url> -n other -d src/otherlib`
    ["other"] = { source = "github:user/repo/some/other.lua@main", path = "src/otherlib/other.lua" }
  }
}

    name (string): Project name.
    lua (string, optional): Minimum or specific Lua version required for the project. Accepts version constraints such as ">=5.1", "=5.1", ">5.1", or "<5.4".
    type (string): Project type, either "library" or "application".
    version (string): Project version.
    license (string): Project license.
    description (string): Project description.
    scripts (table): Project scripts.
    dependencies (table): Project dependencies. Keys are dependency names, values can be strings (version constraints, source URLs) or tables for more complex definitions (e.g., specifying a custom path).

almd-lock.lua

Tracks resolved dependencies for reproducible installs. Example fields:
Lua

return {
  api_version = "1",
  package = {
    -- Entry corresponding to project.lua's ["file"] example above
    file = {
        source = "github:user/repo/path/file.lua@abcdef", -- The exact source identifier
        path = "lib/file.lua",                           -- Relative path within the project
        hash = "sha256:..."                              -- sha256 hash of the downloaded content
        -- OR if source URL contained commit hash:
        -- hash = "commit:abcdef"
    },
    -- Entry corresponding to project.lua's ["other"] example above
    other = {
        source = "github:user/repo/some/other.lua@main", -- The exact source identifier used
        path = "src/otherlib/other.lua",                 -- Custom relative path
        hash = "sha256:..."                              -- sha256 hash of the downloaded content
    }
    -- Example if semver resolution was implemented
    -- lunajson = { version = "1.3.4", hash = "sha256:...", path = "lib/lunajson.lua" },
  }
}

src/lib/

Contains internal reusable Lua modules used by the Almandine package manager itself (e.g., downloader, lockfile handler, argument parser). Not for user-downloaded dependencies.
src/modules/

Contains all CLI command modules (such as init, add, remove, etc.) for the package manager. All new modules must be placed here. Do not place command modules elsewhere. The add.lua module would contain the logic for the add command.
src/main.lua

Main entrypoint for the CLI. Responsible for:

    Parsing CLI arguments (using an internal library from src/lib) and dispatching to the correct command module in src/modules.
    Explicitly handling all standard command aliases (e.g., install/in/ins, remove/rm/uninstall/un, update/up/upgrade, add/i, etc.).
    All usage/help output, documentation, and examples must use almd as the CLI tool name (never almandine).
    When adding or modifying commands or aliases, update src/main.lua to ensure all are handled, and update documentation/tasks accordingly.

install/

Contains cross-platform wrapper scripts for launching the CLI application:

    almd: POSIX shell script for Linux/macOS; finds a suitable Lua interpreter, runs from its own directory, dispatches all arguments to src/main.lua.
    almd.ps1: PowerShell script for Windows; finds a suitable Lua interpreter, runs from its own directory, sets LUA_PATH so src/lib modules are found, dispatches all arguments to src/main.lua.

5. Conclusion

Almandine aims to provide a simple, robust, and reproducible workflow for Lua projects that need lightweight dependency management and script automation, without the complexity of full dependency trees.
Tech Stack

    Lua 5.1â€“5.4 / LuaJIT 2.1
    Platform: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)

Project-Specific Coding Rules

These rules supplement the mandatory Global AI Project Guidelines. They define standards and practices unique to this specific project.
1. Language, Environment & Dependencies

    Target Language: Lua 5.1.
    Compatibility: All code must be compatible with Lua versions 5.1 through 5.4 and LuaJIT.
    Dependencies: Strictly NO external dependencies are permitted beyond standard Lua libraries (e.g., io, os, string, table, math) and potentially LuaSocket if required for HTTP requests (needs confirmation if allowed or if native OS tools like curl/wget/PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest will be shelled out to). Decision needed: Native Lua HTTP client (like LuaSocket - adds dependency) or shell out? For cross-platform simplicity without adding Lua deps, shelling out might be preferred initially.

2. Lua Coding Standards

These standards refine the general coding standards for Lua development within this project.
2.1. Style & Formatting

    Base Style: Adhere primarily to the EmmyLua/LuaLS coding style.
    Strings: Prefer double quotes (") for string literals.
    Line Length: Maximum line length is 120 characters.
    Function Calls: Always use parentheses () for function calls, even if no arguments are passed (e.g., my_function() not my_function).
    Naming Conventions:
        Variables and function/method names use snake_case.
        Classes use CamelCase. Acronyms within class names only uppercase the first letter (e.g., XmlDocument).
        Prefer more descriptive names than k and v when iterating with pairs, unless writing a generic table function.
    Type Hinting: Use LuaLS/EmmyLua style annotations (---@tag) for type hinting to provide rich information for language servers and static analysis. Use overlapping tags like ---@param name type and ---@return type which are compatible with both LuaLS and LDoc where possible.

2.2. Documentation & Comments (LuaLS/EmmyLua Focus)

    Docstrings: Every public function, class, module-level table, field, and type alias requires documentation comments using LuaLS/EmmyLua format (starting with ---@tag).
    Common Tags: Include descriptions and utilize common tags such as:
        ---@class Name [Parent] for classes.
        ---@field name type [description] for class or table fields.
        ---@param name type [description] for function parameters.
        ---@return type [description] for function return values.
        ---@type TypeName [description] for complex table shapes or custom types.
        ---@alias Name Type for defining type aliases.
        ---@see OtherSymbol for references.
        ---@usage <example code> for usage examples.
    Clarity: Ensure descriptions clearly explain the purpose and behavior. Markdown within descriptions is permitted.
    Module Documentation: Document modules by annotating the returned table or the main functions/classes within them using the standard tags. Avoid LDoc-specific @module tags.
    LuaLS/EmmyLua Example Format: (Example omitted for brevity, same as original PRD)

2.3. Implementation Notes

    Leverage Lua's strengths (e.g., tables for structures, first-class functions).
    Be aware of common Lua pitfalls (e.g., 1-based indexing vs. 0-based, global variable scope issues, closure behavior).

3. Testing & Behavior Specification (Prototype Phase)

These rules specify how testing and behavior specification, required by the global guidelines, are implemented in this project using the busted framework during the current prototype phase. The focus during this phase is exclusively on end-to-end (E2E) testing to validate core user flows and system integration.

    Specification Location: During the prototype phase, all end-to-end behavior specifications must reside within the `/src/spec/e2e/` directory. This directory's structure must mirror the `/src` directory structure excluding the `spec/` part itself.
        Example: E2E specifications for the add command (`src/modules/add.lua`) belong in `src/spec/e2e/modules/add_spec.lua`.
    File Naming: Specification files must end with _spec.lua.
    Framework: Use the busted testing framework for all specifications.
    Test Type Focus: As this is the prototype phase, testing efforts must concentrate only on end-to-end tests. Unit and integration tests, along with the heavy use of test doubles (spies, stubs, mocks) for isolating components, are deferred until a later stage. E2E tests should verify system behavior from an external perspective, simulating user interactions via the CLI (almd ...) or by invoking src/main.lua programmatically with arguments.
    Test Sandboxing & Scaffolding: E2E tests must run in isolated, temporary directories (sandboxes) to prevent interference with the main project or other tests. A helper utility/module (e.g., `src/spec/e2e/helpers/scaffold.lua`) should be developed to:
        Create temporary project directories before tests.
        Initialize a basic project.lua file within the sandbox if needed.
        Run the almd command (or simulate its execution via main.lua) targeting the sandboxed project.
        Provide functions for asserting file existence, file content, project.lua content, and almd-lock.lua content within the sandbox.
        Clean up the temporary directory after tests.
    Scenario Coverage: Each E2E specification should describe the system's behavior under various conditions using describe and it blocks, focusing on complete flows or features. Include scenarios covering, at minimum:
        Expected Behavior: Typical, successful user flows or system interactions (the "happy path").
        Boundary Conditions: Behavior at known limits or edge cases within a flow.
        Undesired Situations: System response to errors, invalid inputs, or exceptional conditions during an end-to-end operation.
    Require Paths: Within specification files (_spec.lua), use full, project-relative module paths for require statements when needing entry points or helper modules (e.g., require("src.main") or require("src.spec.e2e.helpers.scaffold")). Do not use local relative paths.

3.1. Example E2E Specification Scenarios (add command)

The following outlines the E2E test cases required for the add command, to be implemented in src/spec/e2e/modules/add_spec.lua using busted and the sandboxing helper.
